An s-shaped three-parameter (S3) fundamental diagram model expressed by $v=\frac{{{v}_{f}}}{{{\left[ 1+{{\left( {k}/{{{k}_{c}}}\; \right)}^{m}} \right]}^{{2}/{m}\;}}}$, where ${{v}_{f}}$, ${{k}_{c}}$, and $m$ are the free-flow speed, the critical density, and the flatness-of-curve parameter respectively, is proposed in this study.
